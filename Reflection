Overall, I see my major project as a huge success. I wasn't exactly sure on what I would be able to accomplish in the limited time available in the semester, but I managed to 
predict what I was capable of and create what I believe is a solid product.

A coding error that I ran into and was somewhat common with my project was me trying to create interactable objects from any arrays or variables that had been previously coded,
essentially meaning that I had troubles with making a nice looking UI to interact with all the behind the scenes code and ideas I had for the project. But with a lot of hard work
I found ways for the user to interact with all the code behind the game, and it made a nice looking product in the end which I am proud of.

A mechanical error I encountered a few times was, when using a different machine than before, having to scale the position of various objects from the resolution of the monitor.
I eventually settled on using my monitor at home (where I coded most of my project) rather than finding a middle ground. Additionally, I had to re-download my github folder to
my computer because it had broken itself. This happened only a handfull of times and was rather undamaging to my progress as a whole.
