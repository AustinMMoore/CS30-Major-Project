# Major Project Proposal:

Chamber of Echoes is a turn based card game in which you encounter random monsters and fight attempt to defeat them by using the cards you have collected in your deck. Defeating enemies grants gold, which is a the true measure of an adventurer! Collect as much gold as you can before you are defeated!
