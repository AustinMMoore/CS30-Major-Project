# Major Project Proposal:

Chamber of Echoes is a turn based deck building card game in which you encounter random monsters and fight attempt to defeat them by using the cards you have collected in your deck. Defeating enemies grants new cards in your deck in order to build your deck and its power!

1. Fully traversable menu system (back buttons, and all buttons functional)
2. Backgrounds that change with the respective 'gameModes'
3. Button class with multiple button appearances
4. Background music & general sound
5. Monster combat
6. Functional deck and hand with cards
7. Turn based gameplay
8. Basic art for cards / buttons / backgrounds


## Nice to Have List:

1. Gold / Shop system
2. EXP / Level system
3. Larger boss type enemies
4. Encounter map (levels)
5. More improved artwork
6. Exchangable cards in deck (add / remove through mechanics)
